<h2 dir="ltr">1. Live Music.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I'm not going to give a semi-list of places that have live
music because the majority of bars and cafe's in the French Quarters
have live music, and I don't mean a DJ; I mean live aspiring singers and
instumentalists with great vibes, tuning it out all day for those
willing to listen. The talent and feel-good time is real here (I know it
sounds cheesy).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>These people are hardly getting outside of their comfort zone.</strong></p>

<div class="Museum-container" id="museum"> 

<h2 dir="ltr">2. Museum/Galleries.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">You want something quieter; more historical, then the museum
is a great place to start.
<strong>Not eveyone is looking for noise.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Don't miss out on the Cabildo and the Presbytere, to 
name a few. Also make stops at the low-key Art Galleries, like: 
Gallery Arlo or the  Pamela Marquis Studio. If you want to try other 
galleries, try:

<div class="Nightlife-container" id="night"> 

<h2 dir="ltr">3. Nightlife.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the bars become somewhat of club scene. The entarnce 
is free. Bars are so close so can walk to most, if not all of them. 
Monday through Friday is more of a jazz-flow, more for the older soul.
The weekend is where you see a lot of college kids hitting the strip. 
The music is more new school, hip-hop and techno. </p>

 <div class="food-container" id="food">  

<h2 dir="ltr">4. Food.</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> Wow, there is a lot of food here. Don't miss
out of New Orleans favorites like: fried oysters, crawfish, and PoBoy.
If you're trying to go to more popular places, be ready to make a line.
You're not the only with Google or Yelp, if you read up on it, 
everybody else has too.

 <div class="mardi gras-container" id="party">  

<h2 dir="ltr">5. Mardi Gras.</h2>
<p dir="ltr"> I saved this one for last not necessarily because 
it's the best (to many it is), but because it's not all year round
and it very, very crowded. This may not be everybody's cup of tea, 
but to those that love the party scene, meeting ALOT of 
different people, this is the place. This time of year is where all
the above (not so much the museum) blend together in the most
high pumping way (so I've heard).
